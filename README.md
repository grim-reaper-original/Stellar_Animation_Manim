# Stellar_Animation_Manim
Manim code which animates and describes the evolution of a star from birth to death

# Overview
This project aims to display the various stages of a Star's life (in this project, we have taken a Main Sequence star akin to the Sun), and showcase the possibilities of its endstate. We have used the Python-based code Manim, developed by Grant Sanderson (owner of 3Blue1Brown).
